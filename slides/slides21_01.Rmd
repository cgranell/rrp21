### If you were to reproduce a paper...

1. .large[check the published manuscript to reproduce,] 

1. .large[download associated data and code (and computational environment),]

1. .large[run the analytical stuff, and ]

1. .large[compare the results to the published results. ]

### "I have never heard of reproducibility before"

### "I do theoretical stuff. Reproduction is not for me"
