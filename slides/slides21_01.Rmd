### If you were to reproduce a paper...

1. .large[check the published manuscript to reproduce,] 

1. .large[download associated data and code (and computational environment),]

1. .large[run the analytical stuff, and ]

1. .large[compare the results to the published results. ]

## Ok, I got it. But getting started is difficult!

### "I have never heard of reproducibility before"

--

### "I'm not good at using tools. _You said github?_"

--

### "I have never been trained"

--

### "I don't know where to find tutorials, guidelines..." 

--

### "I'm superbusy! I do not have enough time"

--

### "I do theoretical stuff. Reproduction is not for me"

- Name things in machine- and human-readable manner

- Order by default: 
  - For scripts, start file names with numbers indicating the position of the script in the analysis: `01_download_data.R`

  - for data, you can use dates as prefix: `20200115_survey.csv`

### A license is a contract between the authors and the users. 

- Without a license, **copyright** is automatically attached to your work. 

- Always **add a license to software** you plan to make public
 - Permissive = attribution (recommended for academic work)

 - Copyleft = share-alike (derivate work maintain same license as the original)
 
- Always **add a license to data** you plan to make public

### Turn you project folder into a local version control repository

- to keep track changes of your work

- to provide a complete historical log of your project 

- to handle properly text formats (code, text documents, markdown documents) as opposed to rich/binary formats (Word).
