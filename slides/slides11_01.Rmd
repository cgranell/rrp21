### Boyle could not replicate this effect in his own air pump in UK.

### Huygens was invited to UK (1663) to personally help Boyle __replicate__ anomalous suspension of water.

# “science is in crisis” narrative is wrong 

### `r Cite(my_refs, "fanelli2018")`: _`r my_refs["fanelli2018"]$title`_

> The new “science is in crisis” narrative is not only empirically unsupported, but also quite obviously counterproductive. Instead of inspiring younger generations to do more and better science, it might foster in them cynicism and indifference. Instead of inviting greater respect for and investment in research, it risks discrediting the value of evidence and feeding antiscientific agendas.

> Therefore, contemporary science could be more accurately portrayed as facing “new opportunities and challenges” or even a “revolution”. __Efforts to promote transparency and reproducibility would find complete justification in such a narrative of transformation and empowerment__, a narrative that is not only more compelling and inspiring than that of a crisis, but also better supported by evidence.

# Summary

### Reproducibility involves the .coldinline[ORIGINAL] data and code:
1. checking the published manuscript, 
1. looking for published data and code, then 
1. comparing the results of that data and code to the published results. 
1. if they are the same, the study is reproducible; otherwise, it is not.


### Replicability involves .fatinline[NEW] data collection to test for consistency with previous results of a smiliar study.

- Replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence.`r Cite(my_refs, "nosek2020")` 
- Replication is accumulated  evidence 
- Even when paper is computationally reproducible, it may fail to be replicated
